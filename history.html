              Destiny Kids Rescue Centre & School is community based organization founded in 2010 January.
The Centre was established to cater for orphans , abandoned children in the City of Nairobi , lacking the basic needs e.g. shelter, clothing ,food,medication ,parental care ,counseling and most of all education which is essential for their later lives.<br><br>




The founder of this centre was sponsored by one American ,the owner of Magadi Soda company. This man had employed her step brother in that company whose wages we very small and acted as a good Samaritan by educating her.

She is proud of what she accomplished as a result of that scholarship.<br><br>
The founder of this Centre felt that through the centre she too could change the lives of many children who will otherwise make it in life because the basic needs were inaccessible and thus they would be unable to achieve their dreams.
<br>
Most parents of this children have perished as a result of a deadly virus known as HIV/AIDS, due to poverty and illiteracy parents are dying like flies leaving behind parentless children, some are already HIV Positive and this leads to discrimination and isolation, thus causing some to end up in the streets exposed to dangers that accompany such life.

All in all you and I can change the lives of many if we unite . If we work together.<br><br>

Destiny Kids Rescue Centre is in East Africa -Kenya in Nairobi County , Starehe District , Mathare Division -Huruma next to Mathare Slums.

The Centre has 31 children who fully rely on donation from good Samaritan.  The centre operates in one Iron Sheet soldering a school which has Pre-primary and Primary Classes 1-8.

The Centre also provides education to other children from the community who come from less disadvantaged families thus it has a total of 300 pupils and 7 teachers who offer voluntary services with two house mothers including a cook.

Our future plans is to accommodate total orphans in the centre but due to lack of funds we give them food ,clothing and education.<br><br>
We are looking for financial help as well as partnerships and second hand donations.

We hope this website can help us to find sponsors, well wishers, donors, partners and friends in order to contribute in some way to our school.


Please feel free to contact us and have a look on our website. We appreciate every sort of contact with people who feel committed.
